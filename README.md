# Musubi

### *The world's buggiest programming language*

**version indev 0.5.0**

> "look mom I'm writing a readme"

Musubi is a programming language developed with the goal of eliminating all unnecessary characters from the syntax, to make writing code less tedious.

Musubi is developed by one person, for no real reason, and is not intended to ever be used "for real"â€”mainly because it is really slow. It's certainly not optimized speed-wise, but being written in Javascript there's not a lot that can be done about that.

I'm really not sure why I'm writing all of this, because there's basically no chance that anyone else will ever read it. Anyway, that's about all I've got to put here, and no, there's no good reason for the name.
